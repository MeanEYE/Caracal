# User conditional tag - `cms:user`

Tags contained within `cms:user` will only be parsed and displayed if user is logged in regardless of users permissions.

In the following example, `H1` will be displayed only for user that is currently logged in.

```xml
<div class="article">
	<cms:user>
		<h1>Title</h1>
	</cms:user>
	<p>Article content</p>
</div>
```
